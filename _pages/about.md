I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zurich. I earned my PhD in Economic from [CERNA](https://www.cerna.minesparis.psl.eu/Presentation/) in École des Mines Paris and [CREST](https://crest.science) in École polytechnique.<br/>

My research lies at the intersection of Political Economy, Political Science, and Computational Social Sciences, with a focus on European Studies. I am particularly interested in studying how to extract ideologies from large text corpora.<br/>

My empirical work draws upon machine learning algorithms and social media data to quantify two main effects: (1) the extent to which institutional design affects social norms and behaviors, and (2) how political ideologies have evolved over time.<br/>

In parallel I am working for [DemoSquare](https://demosquare.ch/landing/), an online platform for automating the monitoring and the analysis of legal and political data with machine learning.
