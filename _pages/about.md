I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Political Science at the University of Zurich. I earned my PhD in Economic from CERNA in École des Mines Paris and CREST in École polytechnique under the supervision of Pr. Pierre Fleckinger (CERNA) and Pr. Alessandro Riboni (CREST).<br/>

My research lies at the intersection of Political Economy, Political Science, and Computational Social Sciences, with a focus on European Studies. I am particularly interested in studying how to extract ideologies from large text corpora.<br/>

My empirical work draws upon machine learning algorithms and social media data to quantify two main effects: (1) the extent to which institutional design affects social norms and behaviors, and (2) how political ideologies have evolved over time.</div>
