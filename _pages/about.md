<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am Hugo Subtil, PhD student at CERNA in École des Mines Paris and CREST in École polytechnique  under the supervision of *Pr. Pierre Fleckinger* (CERNA) and *Pr. Alessandro Riboni* (CREST). I am gratuated in Economics from École polytechnique (Master in Economics).

My research lies at the intersection of Political Economy, Political Science, and Computational Social Sciences, with a focus on European Studies. I am particularly interested in studying how to extract ideologies from large text corpora.

My empirical work draws upon machine learning algorithms and social media data to quantify two main effects: (1) the extent to which institutional design affects social norms and behaviors, and (2) how political ideologies have evolved over time.</div>
